Look at packages.lisp and loader.lisp to proceed. 

Spec-rel related problems are in spec-rel.lisp. The semi-prover is implemented in semi-prover.lisp. 

The visualiztion system is sort of a kludge now. 

Feel free to mail me if you run into any problems or need any help. 

The code works perfectly in SBCL 1.0.55 uni-threaded version on Mac OS X 10.5.7.
You need to install graphviz and dot2tex and need to have Latex installed for the visualization system to work.
